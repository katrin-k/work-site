  <h2>Freelance Work</h2>
  <p>I'm a frontend developer around all things &#8902;HTML&#8902;CSS&#8902;JS&#8902;.</p>
  <p>I most care about usability and accessibility. Which are the same thing for me.</p>

  <h3>What I do</h3>
  <ul class="activities-list">
    <li class="activities-item">Good old vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
    <li class="activities-item">JS frameworks (preferrably Vue or React).</li>
    <li class="activities-item">Static Sites: Think Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo or ….</li>
    <li class="activities-item">Take care of the CSS of your project (think maintainability, composability and scalability).</li>
    <li class="activities-item">Accessible templating for your website or web app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>An ideal setting for my next project would be…</h3>
  <ul class="tech-list">
    <li>… to work in a team with visual and/or UX designer(s), backenders and fellow frontenders …</li>
    <li>… in a company that cares about inclusive work environments …</li>
    <li>… as well as including their users in the product development cycle.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Things I'm currently looking into (read: would love to put those learnings into a real world product)</h3>
  <ul class="tech-list">
    <li>Storybooks</li>
    <li>SVG and animations</li>
    <li>Creating accessible Vue components</li>
    <li>CSS for non-experts</li>
  </ul>
