  <p>
    Web applications and websites are always part of a bigger picture. With past
    work experiences as diverse as project management, customer support,
    accounting or academic research in both big and small organizations, i am
    able to take on perspectives from all relevant stakeholders.
  </p>
  <p>
    I develop usable, accessible frontends. HTML & CSS receive the same
    attention as JavaScript does.
