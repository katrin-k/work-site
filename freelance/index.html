  <h1>Frontend Development & Consulting</h1>
  {% include availability.html available='available' %}

  <p>
    Ahoj! My name is Katrin Kampfrath. I develop usable and accessible
    frontends. HTML & CSS receive the same attention as JavaScript does.
  </p>
  <p>
    Web applications and websites are always part of a bigger picture.
  </p>
  <p>
    With past work experiences as diverse as project management, customer
    support, accounting or academic research in both big and small
    organizations, i am able to take on perspectives from all relevant
    stakeholders.
